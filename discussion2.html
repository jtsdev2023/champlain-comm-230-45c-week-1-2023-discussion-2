            I rated myself high on the following items. In my mind, the main reason you wouldn't do well with one of 
            these items is lack of confidence, fear of feeling stupid, fear of being wrong, and/or fear of criticism. 
            After 18 years in the IT field, I for the most part have set these aside, and I no longer care if people/peers 
            think I'm stupid or don't know what I'm doing.

            There are a few aspects of IT work that I have really come to appreciate:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The breadth of technologies is vast, and, unless you're a savant and can do it all well, there is 
                    going to be things you don't know.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is unlimted potential to study and learn.

                    There's always somebody smarter and that knows more.

    <li>Weaknesses/Areas in need of improvement
        <ul>
            <li>Small group participation
                <p>
                    My perception is that most of my small group participation is a negative experience due to
                    bickering and infighting. 
                    As such, I generally tried to avoid it, if I can.
                    But, avoiding small group participation in the information technology (IT) field is difficult. 
                    I'm hoping this course will help me become more proficient at small group communication and alleviate 
                    my aversion to small group participation.

            </li>
            <li>Share my thoughts and ideas
                <p>
                    If the small group communication is not going well, I have a tendency to bottle up and only 
                    minimally participate. This is a weak area I would like to improve on, and I'm working through 
                    this course with that in mind.

            <li>Hubris
                <p>
                    Something not in exercise 1.2 that I struggle with in small group communication is hubris or thinking 
                    I know it all. Most of my small group communication is centered around technical items, and, after 18 
                    years in the field, I have caught myself being arrogant and a "know it all", which is bad. 
                    So I actively monitor my behavior for self adjustment/correction.
